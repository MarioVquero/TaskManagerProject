# Task Manager

Hello there this is a project that as of 5/15/2024 I have completed the video but have not changed anything.
based off of the tutorial by: [John Smilga](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwfE7fSVaZM&t=196s)

Will have this saved somewhere else
[Mongoose Docs](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html)



Considering most of this project is made using the tutorial once complete ill attempt to add more features for the sake of not following the tutorial and leaving the project without adding anything.
Changes I plan to make
<ul>
    <li>Adding an auth system and way login</li>
    <li>change the style and hopefully</li>
</ul>

going to list the files I cant take credit for as well since it was given for the tutorial

<ul>
    <li>package.json</li>
    <li>gitignore file ( will probably add on to this theres only 2 lines)</li>
    <li>Everything in the public folder as of writing this</li>
</ul>



Reminders and Notices for me
<ul>
    <li>Tutorial Complete move on to the next one</li>
    <li>some stuff may be deprecated </li>
    <li>if some code doesnt work thats probably why </li>
    <li>for more info on validations check the docs </li>
    <li>try using HTTP cats because its funny </li>
    <li>will deploy later after going over auth</li>
    <li>Record demo for now since people wont be able to access/use site without auth</li>
</ul>
