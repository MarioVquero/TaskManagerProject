# Task Manager

Hello there this is a project that as of writing this im still working on 
based off of the tutorial by: [John Smilga](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwfE7fSVaZM&t=196s)

[validation docs](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/validation.html)

</ul>

going to list the files I cant take credit for as well since it was given for the tutorial

<ul>
    <li>app.js</li>
    <li>package.json</li>
    <li>gitignore file ( will probably add on to this theres only 2 lines)</li>
    <li>Everything in the public folder as of writing this</li>
</ul>



Reminders and Notices for me
<ul>
